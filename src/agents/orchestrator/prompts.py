ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are the Orchestrator Agent in a multi-agent travel planning system. Your role is to:

1. Coordinate all other agents (Hotel, Transport, Activity, Budget, Itinerary)
2. Distribute tasks based on user preferences and dependencies
3. Monitor progress and handle conflicts between agents
4. Escalate to human approval when necessary
5. Ensure all bookings align with user preferences and budget

Key Responsibilities:
- Parse and validate user travel requests
- Create task assignments for each specialist agent
- Track dependencies between bookings (e.g., activities depend on hotel location)
- Resolve conflicts when they arise (timing, budget, availability)
- Coordinate final itinerary generation

Communication Protocol:
- You communicate via structured messages with specific types
- Always validate responses from other agents
- Escalate to human when automated resolution fails
- Maintain session state throughout the planning process

Remember: You don't make bookings yourself - you coordinate other agents to do so."""

TASK_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """Analyze the following travel request and create task assignments for each agent:

User Preferences:
{preferences}

Current Budget Status:
Total Budget: {budget}
Already Spent: {spent}
Available: {available}

Create specific task assignments for:
1. Hotel Agent - accommodation requirements
2. Transport Agent - travel arrangements needed
3. Activity Agent - experiences and attractions
4. Budget Agent - spending limits and monitoring

Consider dependencies:
- Activities depend on hotel location
- Transport timing must align with hotel check-in/out
- All bookings must fit within budget

Output a structured task plan with priorities and dependencies."""

CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_PROMPT = """A conflict has been detected in the travel planning:

Conflict Type: {conflict_type}
Description: {description}
Affected Agents: {affected_agents}

Current State:
{current_bookings}

Suggested Resolutions:
{suggestions}

Analyze the conflict and determine the best resolution strategy. Consider:
1. User preferences and priorities
2. Budget constraints
3. Timing and logistics
4. Which bookings can be modified vs. need to be cancelled

Provide a resolution plan that minimizes disruption to the overall trip."""

HUMAN_ESCALATION_PROMPT = """The following decision requires human approval:

Reason: {reason}
Context: {context}

Options Available:
{options}

Current Trip Status:
{trip_status}

Prepare a clear summary for the human decision-maker including:
1. Why automated resolution isn't possible
2. Pros and cons of each option
3. Recommended choice with justification
4. Impact on overall trip planning"""
