## Discovered During Work

### Issues Found

1. **No Production Configuration**
   - SSL certificates not generated
   - Production environment variables missing
   - No deployment configuration

2. **Missing Integration Points**
   - Orchestrator doesn't connect to all agents
   - State sharing between agents incomplete
   - No real API integrations

3. **Security Gaps**
   - Rate limiting not fully implemented
   - CORS configuration missing
   - Input validation incomplete

### Technical Debt

1. **Code Duplication**
   - Security middleware repeated in each agent
   - Similar A2A setup code across agents
   - Could benefit from base classes

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Hardcoded values in some places
   - Inconsistent environment variable usage
   - No configuration validation

3. **Logging**
   - Basic logging only
   - No structured logging format
   - Missing correlation IDs

## Definition of Done

For each task to be considered complete:
1. Code implemented and working
2. Unit tests written and passing
3. Integration tests passing
4. Documentation updated
5. Code reviewed and refactored
6. Error handling implemented
7. Logging added
8. Security considerations addressed

## Notes

- The system is well-architected but incomplete
- Security foundation is solid
- A2A protocol implementation is good
- Main gaps are missing agents and tests
- Production deployment needs work
